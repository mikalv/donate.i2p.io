    <h2>About</h2>
    <div>

<p>The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) began in 2003 as the Invisible IRC Project. Since that time it has continued as a research and development driven project with a focus on providing privacy and protection for communications on its network. It is Open Source and free to connect to and use. </p>

<p>The Invisible Internet provides architectural boundaries - its network is developed with privacy by design. I2P was not designed with profit-driven or intelligence-driven goals. It obfuscates your traffic and puts you in control of your space that you create on its network. You are in control of your discoverability and what you consider private, social or public.</p>

<p>The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) supports the right to access. The project works to constantly improve its circumvention abilities and resistance. Once you are connected to the I2P network, your traffic and communications are protected.</p>

<b>Who Uses I2P?</b>

<p>People who are concerned about their privacy and interested in alternatives to the internet make use of the network and its applications to chat, email, torrent and run their own sites and forums. In some circumstances individuals rely on the network to communicate due to safety issues or censorship. Researchers, developers and digital rights defenders are I2P users as well.</p>

<b>How is The Invisible Internet Project Funded and How Is That Funding Used?</b>

<p>The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is 100% community funded. In the past the Project has received a grant from DuckDuckGo, and has received support from the OTF Usability Lab providers. This helped to guide improvements to the Java software and website UX and information architecture.â€¨Donations support I2P maintainers server costs, and other costs associated with keeping the network services up and running. Donations support improving the I2P protocol, application layer, and ensuring that the network is accessible and its software is easy to use.</p>

<b>Who handles the money?</b>

<p>The Invisible Internet Project is registered in Norway as a non-profit organization, much alike US's 501(c) Organization type.</p>

<p>The registration number with the Norwegian government is <a style="color:#FFF;" href="https://w2.brreg.no/enhet/sok/detalj.jsp?orgnr=913935802">913935802</a>.</p>
